    <title>Another Criminologist Takes On the Lead-Crime Hypothesis</title>
    <link>http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2014/04/another-criminologist-takes-lead-crime-hypothesis</link>
    <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"&gt;
&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Kleiman points me today to a critique from criminologist Phil Cook of the lead-crime hypothesis. Unlike some others, however, &lt;a href="http://www.samefacts.com/2014/04/crime-incarceration/lead-and-crime-a-hole-in-the-theory/" target="_blank"&gt;this is a sensible one:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Even a fairly casual glance at the data demonstrates that whatever the cause of the crime surge, and then the crime drop, it was not associated with particular cohorts. It was an environmental effect &amp;mdash; 10 cohorts were swept up in the crime surge simultaneously, and the drop has the same correlated pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;There is a natural inclination to assume that the reason the murder rate is increasing is because there are more murderers, and the reason we have fewer is that there are fewer murderers. It&amp;rsquo;s not that I rule out such explanations&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; I&amp;rsquo;m open to the idea of lead removal and abortion legalization&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; it&amp;rsquo;s just that I don&amp;rsquo;t think it explains the actual pattern of the youth violence epidemic, either up or down. More generally, my instinct is to look to the social and economic environment to explain large shifts in population outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cook is arguing that because ambient lead levels changed over time (rising from 1945-70 and then falling after that), it affects particular age cohorts differently. This means we should see different crime rates from different age groups. In fact, we see rises and then falls in lots of cohorts at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've scanned through &lt;a href="http://www.samefacts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Crime-Justice-2002-after-epidemic.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Cook's paper,&lt;/a&gt; but I haven't yet read it thoroughly. However, it's focused primarily on the mid-80s through the mid-90s, which might skew things since there are quite a few age cohorts during that era which suffered from pretty severe childhood lead poisoning. It's also worth pointing out that lead poisoning affected &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; age cohort born from about 1950 through 1980, and the differences in lead exposure between those cohorts are significant but not overwhelming. The crime wave that started in the 60s got steadily worse through the early 90s not just because 18-year-olds got progressively more poisoned (though they did) but because more and more age cohorts were suffering the effects of childhood lead exposure at the same point in time. In other words, seeing a rise and fall in multiple age cohorts is about what you'd expect to see if the lead hypothesis is correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, I'd emphasize, as I often do, that crime is a complex affair and lead is only a part of the story. We shouldn't expect any single theory to explain the data perfectly. There are just too many moving parts for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, don't take my response to Cook's critique too seriously. I'm an amateur, and it needs attention from experts who can evaluate his argument more rigorously. However, &lt;a href="http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2014/04/criminologist-takes-lead-crime-hypothesis" target="_blank"&gt;a few days ago&lt;/a&gt; I was complaining about the low quality of critics of the lead hypothesis, and now I have a high-quality critic. So I wanted to pass it along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;

    <title>Which Bundy Said It: Cliven, Al, Ted, or McGeorge?</title>
    <link>http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/04/cliven-bundy-quotes-quiz</link>

&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cliven Bundy, everybody's favorite Nevada &lt;a href="http://www.thewire.com/politics/2014/04/even-glenn-beck-wasnt-so-sure-about-this-cliven-bundy-fellow/361188/" target="_blank"&gt;land-fee delinquent&lt;/a&gt;, took it to another level&amp;nbsp;this week&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/04/24/prior-to-slavery-comments-bundy-said-minority-groups-are-against-us/?Post+generic=%3Ftid%3Dsm_twitter_washingtonpost" target="_blank"&gt;by questioning whether black people&lt;/a&gt; were better off as slaves. Bundy&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/04/24/rand-paul-and-other-republican-leaders-back-away-from-bundy/" target="_blank"&gt;insists his comments weren't racist&lt;/a&gt;, just that he's "wondering" if black people have traded traditional slavery for slavery to the US government, in the form of subsidies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Cliven Bundy's words ricochet through the news cycle, it's worth noting that he's not the only Bundy who's had some whack things to say in the annals of American history. Can you guess which Bundy uttered&amp;nbsp;the truly&lt;em&gt;&amp;hellip;special&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip;quotes below?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>My Life in the New American Minimum Wage Economy</title>
    <link>http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/04/american-minimum-wage-economy-retail-state-department-whistle-blower</link>
    <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"&gt;
&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This &lt;a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175835/" target="_blank"&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; first appeared on the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/" target="_blank"&gt;TomDispatch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; website.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many sides to whistleblowing. The one that most people don't know about is the very personal cost, &lt;a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175591/peter_van_buren_the_persecution_of_John_Kiriakou"&gt;prison aside&lt;/a&gt;, including the high cost of lawyers and the strain on family relations, that follows the decision to risk it all in an act of conscience. Here's a part of my own story I've not talked about much before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At age 53, everything changed. Following my whistleblowing first book, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0805096817/ref=nosim/?tag=tomdispatch-20"&gt;&lt;em&gt;We Meant Well: How I Helped Lose the Battle for the Hearts and Minds of the Iraqi People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I was &lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/04/12/the_man_the_state_dept_wants_silenced/"&gt;run out of the good job&lt;/a&gt; I had held for more than 20 years with the US Department of State. As one of its threats, State also took aim at the pension and benefits I'd earned, even as it forced me into retirement. Would my family and I lose everything I'd worked for as part of the &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/post/state-dept-moves-to-fire-peter-van-buren-author-of-book-critical-of-iraq-reconstruction-effort/2012/01/31/gIQAiXNSCS_blog.html"&gt;retaliation campaign&lt;/a&gt; State was waging? I was worried. That pension was the thing I'd counted on to provide for us and it remained in jeopardy for many months. I was scared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span class="inline inline-left"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="image image-preview" height="33" src="http://motherjones.com/files/images/tdispatch-notch.jpg" title="" width="100"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;My skill set was pretty specific to my old job. The market was tough in the Washington, DC area for someone with a &lt;a href="http://diplopundit.net/2011/10/18/devastating-tsunami-hits-peter-van-buren-security-clearance-and-diplomatic-ppt-swept-away-in-foggy-waters/"&gt;suspended security clearance&lt;/a&gt;. Nobody with a salaried job to offer seemed interested in an old guy, and I needed some money. All the signs pointed one way&amp;mdash;toward the retail economy and a minimum-wage job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And soon enough, I did indeed find myself working in exactly that economy and, worse yet, trying to live on the money I made. But it wasn't just the money. There's this American thing in which jobs define us, and those definitions tell us what our individual futures and the future of our society is likely to be. And believe me, rock bottom is a miserable base for any future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;p style="font-size: 1.083em;"&gt;&lt;a href="/politics/2014/04/american-minimum-wage-economy-retail-state-department-whistle-blower"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Continue Reading &amp;raquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>15 MB of Fame: Never-Before-Seen Digital Art by Andy Warhol</title>
    <link>http://www.motherjones.com/mixed-media/2014/04/andy-warhol-digital-amiga-art</link>
    <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"&gt;
&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making art with a computer ain't easy. Just ask Andy Warhol. The American icon mastered numerous art forms and shaped our culture with his work. But a newly-discovered &lt;a href="http://press.cmoa.org/2014/04/24/hpi-warhol-amiga/" target="_blank"&gt;collection of files&lt;/a&gt; from 41 floppy disks&amp;mdash;yes, floppy disks&amp;mdash;shows that he struggled with early digital design tools. Today, members of Carnegie Mellon University's &lt;a href="http://www.club.cc.cmu.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Computer Club&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://studioforcreativeinquiry.org/" target="_blank"&gt;STUDIO for Creative Inquiry&lt;/a&gt; in Pittsburgh released a previously unseen set of images Warhol created in the 1980s using a Commodore Amiga 1000. (That used to be a type of computer, kids.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work was discovered after artist &lt;a href="http://www.coryarcangel.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Cory Arcangel&lt;/a&gt; found a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oqUd8utr14" target="_blank"&gt;fuzzy You Tube video&lt;/a&gt; from 1985. In it Warhol sits next to Blondie singer Debbie Harry and uses the Amiga to paint her digital portrait. Jonathan Gaugler of the Carnegie Museum of Art says Arcangel was "relatively sure" the disks containing Warhol's digital prints would be housed in the Warhol Museum. Sure enough, they were. But, Gaugler says, "It's risky. Because reading them in a drive, there is a chance of wiping it just by trying."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the museum's curator, Tina Kukielski, connected Arcangel with the Carnegie Mellon's Computer Club, which wrote original code to safely read the data without damaging it. The process was captured in the upcoming documentary film series &lt;a href="http://members.carnegiemuseums.org/site/Calendar?id=74995&amp;amp;view=Detail" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Invisible Photograph&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, premiering May 10 at the Carnegie Library Lecture Hall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of Warhol's digital works, and stills from documentary showing how they were retrieved. Enjoy&amp;mdash;while listening to Blondie if you can:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why Was the Right Caught Flat-Footed By Cliven Bundy's Cranky Racism?</title>
    <link>http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2014/04/why-was-right-caught-flat-footed-cliven-bundys-cranky-racism</link>
    <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"&gt;
&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now I assume you've all heard about Cliven Bundy's remarks to the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; yesterday? In case you've been vacationing on Mars, &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/24/us/politics/rancher-proudly-breaks-the-law-becoming-a-hero-in-the-west.html?hp" target="_blank"&gt;here they are:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I want to tell you one more thing I know about the Negro,&amp;rdquo; he said. Mr. Bundy recalled driving past a public-housing project in North Las Vegas, &amp;ldquo;and in front of that government house the door was usually open and the older people and the kids &amp;mdash; and there is always at least a half a dozen people sitting on the porch &amp;mdash; they didn&amp;rsquo;t have nothing to do. They didn&amp;rsquo;t have nothing for their kids to do. They didn&amp;rsquo;t have nothing for their young girls to do.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;And because they were basically on government subsidy, so now what do they do?&amp;rdquo; he asked. &amp;ldquo;They abort their young children, they put their young men in jail, because they never learned how to pick cotton. And I&amp;rsquo;ve often wondered, are they better off as slaves, picking cotton and having a family life and doing things, or are they better off under government subsidy? They didn&amp;rsquo;t get no more freedom. They got less freedom.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't have anything to add that (a) isn't obvious and (b) hasn't already been said by someone else, but I do share &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/04/24/cliven-bundy-and-the-perils-of-identity-politics/" target="_blank"&gt;Paul Waldman's reaction:&lt;/a&gt; "Is anyone surprised that Cliven Bundy, the Nevada rancher who has become a Fox News hero because of his stand-off with the Bureau of Land Management, turns out to be a stone-cold racist?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's a good question. Is anyone &lt;em&gt;on the right&lt;/em&gt; surprised by this? (I think it's safe to say that exactly zero lefties are surprised.) That's not a rhetorical question on my part. Look: conservatives should never have rallied around Bundy in the first place, but if they're even minimally self-aware about his particular niche in the conservative base, surely they should have seen something like this coming and kept their distance just out of sheer self-preservation. But apparently they didn't. They didn't have a clue that a guy like Bundy was almost certain to backfire on them eventually. They seem to have spent so long furiously denying so much as a shred of racial resentment anywhere in their base that they've drunk their own Kool-Aid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a tangential note, as near as I can tell Paul Ryan never embraced Bundy publicly. Does anyone know if that's right? It's one reason I think he could be a dangerous presidential candidate. Despite his "inner city" gaffe of a few weeks ago, he's smarter about this stuff than most folks who have managed to stay on the right side of the tea party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;

    <title>Aetna CEO: Obamacare Pretty Much On Track</title>
    <link>http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2014/04/aetna-ceo-obamacare-pretty-much-track</link>
    <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"&gt;
&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aetna is one of America's biggest health insurers, and it's currently operating in 17 different Obamacare exchanges. On a call this morning, CEO Mark Bertolini passed &lt;img align="right" alt="" class="image image-_original" src="/files/blog_aetna_logo.jpg" style="margin: 20px 20px 15px 30px;"&gt;along &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/04/24/aetna-late-obamacare-changes-account-for-half-of-2015-premium-increases/" target="_blank"&gt;a couple of interesting factlets:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Bertolini said about half of the company's premium increases, whatever they turn out to be, will be attributable to "on the fly" regulatory changes made by the Obama administration. He cited as an example the administration's policy of allowing old health plans that were supposed to expire in 2014 to be extended another three years if states and insurers wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;....Aetna has added 230,000 paying customers from ACA exchanges, and it projects to end the year with 450,000 paid customers. It said it can't yet draw a "meaningful conclusion" about the population's overall health status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is interesting because it suggests that Aetna's premium increases won't be based on fundamentals. That is, they aren't rising because the customers Aetna signed up were older or sicker than they expected. That's good news, even if the regulatory shakeouts of Obamacare's early days are causing a bit of pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the second is interesting because Aetna apparently expects to double its Obamacare customer base by the end of the year. &lt;a href="http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2014/03/raw-data-2017-obamacare-will-be-covering-36-million-people" target="_blank"&gt;That's roughly what the CBO projected earlier this year,&lt;/a&gt; and this is a bit of evidence suggesting that they got it right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;

    <title>Here's a Great Argument for Easing Up on Professional Licensing Restrictions</title>
    <link>http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2014/04/heres-great-argument-easing-professional-licensing-restrictions</link>
    <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"&gt;
&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adrianna McIntyre has a fascinating little tidbit up today about how Medicaid expansion affects access to health care. Here's the question: By increasing demand for doctors, is it likely to result in longer wait times for everyone?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A trio of researchers took a look at dental care to get an idea. Some states cover it for adults, some don't. So what happens in states where adult Medicaid is expanded to cover dental care? The first-order answer is surprising: more dentists participate; their incomes go up; and wait times barely budge. But how is that possible? &lt;a href="http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/what-dental-care-can-teach-us-about-coverage-expansions/" target="_blank"&gt;The second-order answer is even more interesting:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Dentists accomplish this mainly by making greater use of hygienists: &lt;strong&gt;following the expansion of public coverage, dentists employ a greater number of hygienists and hygienists provide about 5 additional visits per week.&lt;/strong&gt; As a result, dentists&amp;rsquo; income increases following the adoption of Medicaid adult dental benefits by approximately 7 percent. These effects are largest among dentists who practice in poor areas where Medicaid coverage is most prevalent.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;We also find that these coverage expansions cause wait times to increase modestly [less than a day, on average]. However, this effect varies significantly across states with different policies towards the provision of dental services by hygienists. &lt;strong&gt;The increased wait times are concentrated in states with relatively restrictive scope of practice laws.&lt;/strong&gt; We find no significant increase in wait times in states that allow hygienists greater autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Licensing and "scope of authority" restrictions are sort of a hot topic these days, and this is a pretty good example of why. I haven't yet dived into the whole thing enough to have a settled opinion, but it's becoming fairly common to believe that licensing restrictions are far too strict in some professions, acting more as a way of propping up salaries than as genuine public safety measures. Nurses and hygienists could be given more autonomy, for example, but this is often resisted by doctors and dentists who don't want to give up a lucrative monopoly on the services they provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The arguments are sometimes arcane, but this example brings it down to earth. Ease up on the restrictions placed on hygienists, and dental practices can provide more and better service to the poor&amp;mdash;and, in the end, do it without sacrificing income. That's worth knowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;

    <title>Meet 5 of the Low-Level Drug Offenders Obama Could Set Free. There Are Thousands More Like Them</title>
    <link>http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2014/04/department-justice-clemency-drug-offender</link>
    <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"&gt;
&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, the Department of Justice &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/23/politics/drug-clemency/" target="_blank"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that thousands of federal inmates serving time for certain non-violent crimes will soon be able to apply for clemency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those eligible to be set free will be prisoners convicted of low-level nonviolent crimes&amp;mdash;mostly drug offenses&amp;mdash;who have already served 10 years of their sentence, don't have a significant criminal history, and are serving out a sentence the would likely be shorter had they been convicted for the same crime today. The rule change could apply to some &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/23/politics/drug-clemency/" target="_blank"&gt;2,000&lt;/a&gt; of the 200,000 inmates in federal prison, and is part of a wider effort by the Obama administration to make sentencing laws more fair. Last year, the DOJ &lt;a href="http://swampland.time.com/2013/09/20/obama-expands-mandatory-minimum-sentencing-relief/" target="_blank"&gt;changed sentencing guidelines&lt;/a&gt; to give judges the freedom to determine whether or not to apply mandatory minimums for certain drug charges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are five federal prisoners who will be eligible for clemency under the DOJ's new rules (via &lt;a href="http://famm.org" target="_blank"&gt;Families Against Mandatory Minimums&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weldon Angelos: &lt;/strong&gt;Angelos is serving 55 years for selling a few pounds of marijuana while in possession of a gun. In his early 20s, Angelos founded a successful Utah-based rap label called Extravagant Records, where he wrote and produced songs with artists like Snoop Dogg. In 2002, the Salt Lake City police, who suspected Angelos was part of a local gang, arranged for an informant to purchase marijuana from him. The informant claimed that Angelos had firearms with him during both buys. When the judge in the case was forced to sentence Angelos to a mandatory 55 years, he called the punishment "unjust, cruel, and even irrational," noting that repeat child rapists and airplane hijackers get shorter sentences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="inline inline-left" style="display: table; width: 1%"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="image" src="/files/2_0.png"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sherman Chester:&lt;/strong&gt; Chester is serving life without parole for selling cocaine and heroin as part of a drug ring. Chester started selling small amounts in his 20s and soon got involved in a drug conspiracy headed up by a family friend near Tampa, Florida. After an undercover detective bought from him on several occasions, Chester was indicted in federal court in 1992 along with nine others involved in the ring. He was 25. Chester was sentenced as if he had been in possession of nearly the entire amount of heroin and cocaine found on all members of the conspiracy. The judge who meted out Chester's harsh punishment said, "This man doesn&amp;rsquo;t deserve a life sentence, and there is no way that I can legally keep from giving it to him."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="inline inline-left" style="display: table; width: 1%"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="image" src="/files/3_0.png"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharanda Jones:&lt;/strong&gt; Jones is serving life without parole for allegedly leading a drug ring. After high school, Jones worked as a restaurant manager and cosmetologist. Unable to support her family on her income, she began selling coke and crack in the Dallas area. In 1999, at age 32, Jones was found guilty of taking part in a conspiracy to sell crack, and sentenced to life. Jones received such a harsh sentence because she allegedly carried a gun when she went to buy cocaine from her supplier; because the court considered her a "leader" of the ring; and because she claimed innocence. Her co-conspirators got sentences that ranged between five and 19 years. Jones' daughter, who was eight when Sharanda went to prison, is now an adult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="inline inline-left" style="display: table; width: 1%"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="image" src="/files/4_1.png"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Barbara Scrivner:&lt;/strong&gt; Scrivner is serving 30 years in federal prison for participating in a drug ring. Scrivner was molested as a child, and later fell into drugs and a string of abusive relationships. At age 26, in order to make ends meet, Scrivner started selling small amounts of meth as part of a drug ring. The other participants in the conspiracy were arrested in 1992, but Scrivner initially was spared because she only played a bit part in the ring. A year later, after she refused to testify against the other members, Scrivner was indicted and held accountable for 109 kilos of meth. Once behind bars, Scrivner plunged into depression and attempted suicide by jumping from a 40-foot prison building. She survived, and has since undergone rehab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="inline inline-left" style="display: table; width: 1%"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="image" src="/files/5_0.png"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timothy Tyler:&lt;/strong&gt; Tyler is serving a mandatory life sentence for selling LSD. After high school, Tyler traveled around the country following the Grateful Dead, doing drugs, and being hospitalized for mental health problems. He was arrested a couple of times for selling. In 1992, Tyler sold LSD and marijuana to an informant, and was later charged with possession and conspiracy to distribute along with three other codefendants, one of whom was his father. Partly because of prior convictions, Tyler went to prison for life, while his codefendants only got five to ten years. His father died serving out his term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;

    <title>Here Are Baseball's 2 Least Loved Teams</title>
    <link>http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2014/04/here-are-baseballs-two-least-loved-teams</link>

&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over at &lt;em&gt;The Upshot&lt;/em&gt;, a crack team of researchers has put together an interactive map showing which baseball teams are preferred in which regions of the country. The overall results are pretty predictable, of course, but the authors make a few interesting points about exactly where the geographical dividing lines are between traditional rivalries. I thought the most interesting part was which teams were left out completely. &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/04/23/upshot/24-upshot-baseball.html" target="_blank"&gt;Here's the map:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="middle" alt="" class="image image-_original" src="/files/blog_baseball_regions.jpg" style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 12px 0px 10px 0px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is not a single zip code in the entire country that favors the New York Mets. Even in 11368, the home of Citi Field, fans prefer the Yankees by 53 to 25 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the Oakland A's have it even worse. In 94501, the home of the Oakland Coliseum, fans prefer the San Francisco Giants by a whopping 59 to 18 percent. This is spectacularly embarrassing. The Mets, after all, are at least in the same city as the Yankees, so divided loyalties are natural. The A's are in Oakland, a different city with a culture of its own. Sure, maybe there's no there there, but that's a culture! And yet, even the working-class East Bay has apparently been so taken over by yuppified San Franciscans escaping sky-high rents that the A's can't get any love even after being canonized by Michael Lewis and Brad Pitt as the champions of &lt;em&gt;Moneyball&lt;/em&gt;. Sad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The Toronto Blue Jays aren't on the map either, but I assume that's because the map doesn't include Canada. I draw no conclusions about Toronto's fan base, though I suspect we can assume it's pretty minimal too.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;

    <title>Report: Solitary Confinement Used to Punish Female Prisoners Who Report Rape</title>
    <link>http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2014/04/report-solitary-confinement-used-pregnant-women-and-victims-sexual-assault</link>
    <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"&gt;
&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an incarcerated pregnant woman in Illinois slept too long through mealtime, a guard decided to punish her by placing her in solitary confinement. While in isolation, the woman&amp;mdash;who had a long history of depression&amp;mdash;was denied access to her prenatal vitamins and was not given water for hours. She soon became highly anxious. This is one of the disturbing ways that US prisons treat incarcerated women who are pregnant, transgender, mentally ill, or who report that they are raped, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/worse-second-class" target="_blank"&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt; published Thursday by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the reasons women are placed in isolation are highly subjective, the reports notes: "Because many cases come down to the word of a prisoner against the word of a corrections officer, a guard&amp;rsquo;s bad day can easily turn into a solitary confinement sentence for a prisoner for retaliatory reasons, such as a prisoner&amp;rsquo;s filing a grievance."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solitary confinement, where prisoners are isolated for 22-24 hours a day with greatly reduced human contact and access to sunlight, is &lt;a href="http://www.motherjones.com/special-reports/2012/10/solitary-confinement-shane-bauer" target="_blank"&gt;common practice in US prisons&lt;/a&gt;, but its harmful effects are well-documented. A United Nations torture expert &lt;a href="https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=40097#.U1kJnOvc2BV" target="_blank"&gt;said in 2011&lt;/a&gt; that solitary should never be used on people with mental disabilities, and should never last longer than 15 days. In February, Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) called for US prisons to stop using solitary confinement on vulnerable populations, &lt;a href="http://www.durbin.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/pressreleases?ID=c684591f-9197-4306-8af0-f9914117f287" target="_blank"&gt;including pregnant women.&lt;/a&gt; And recently, the Justice Department &lt;a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/04/doj-solitary-confinement-mentally-ill-children-ohio" target="_blank"&gt;sued&lt;/a&gt; Ohio for placing mentally ill boys in solitary confinement for excessive amounts of time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the ACLU report, guards sometimes use solitary confinement to retaliate against women who report rape by corrections officers. As we &lt;a href="http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2010/05/woman-prisoner-sent-solitary-reporting-rape-guard" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; in 2010, Michelle Ortiz, who was serving one year at the Ohio Reformatory for Women, &lt;a href="http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2010/05/woman-prisoner-sent-solitary-reporting-rape-guard" target="_blank"&gt;alleged&lt;/a&gt; that she was sexually assaulted multiple times by a guard. When she spoke out, she was allegedly placed in solitary confinement. In another case, a prisoner named Lisa Jaramillo served more than 100 days in solitary confinement for allegedly lying about incidents of sexual assault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Women who have been sexually abused by prison guards are...forced to decide between reporting the attack and risking retaliation, or not reporting it and risking further assault," the report reads. The authors note that the lack of privacy in solitary cells can further victimize women. In solitary, a woman's attacker can closely watch her sleep, use the toilet, or undress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;
