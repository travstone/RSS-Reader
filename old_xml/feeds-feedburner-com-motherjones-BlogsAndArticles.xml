	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/nov/20/90-companies-man-made-global-warming-emissions-climate-change" target="_blank"&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; first appeared on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com" target="_blank"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; website and is reproduced here as part of the&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Climate Desk collaboration.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;The climate crisis of the 21st century has been caused largely by just 90 companies, which between them produced nearly two-thirds of the greenhouse gas emissions generated since the dawning of the industrial age, new research suggests.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;The companies range from investor-owned firms&amp;mdash;household names such as &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/chevron" title="More from the Guardian on Chevron"&gt;Chevron&lt;/a&gt;, Exxon, and &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/bp" title="More from the Guardian on BP"&gt;BP&lt;/a&gt;&amp;mdash;to state-owned and government-run firms.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;The analysis, which was welcomed by the former Vice President &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/algore" title="More from the Guardian on Al Gore"&gt;Al Gore&lt;/a&gt; as a "crucial step forward" found that the vast majority of the firms were in the business of producing &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/oil" title="More from the Guardian on Oil"&gt;oil&lt;/a&gt;, gas, or &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/coal" title="More from the Guardian on Coal"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt;, found the analysis, which has been accepted for &lt;a href="http://www.springer.com/earth+sciences+and+geography/atmospheric+sciences/journal/10584" title=""&gt;publication in the journal &lt;em&gt;Climactic Change&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;"There are thousands of oil, gas, and coal producers in the world," climate researcher and author Richard Heede at the Climate Accountability Institute in Colorado said. "But the decision makers, the CEOs, or the ministers of coal and oil if you narrow it down to just one person, they could all fit on a Greyhound bus or two."&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Half of the estimated emissions were produced just in the past 25 years&amp;mdash;well past the date when governments and corporations became aware that rising greenhouse gas emissions from the burning of coal and oil were causing dangerous &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change" title="More from the Guardian on Climate change"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Many of the same companies are also sitting on substantial reserves of fossil fuel, which&amp;mdash;if they are burned&amp;mdash;put the world at even greater risk of dangerous climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Climate change experts said the data set was the most ambitious effort so far to hold individual carbon producers, rather than governments, to account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;

    <title>Here's How Walmart Could Pay Workers a Decent Wage Without Raising Prices</title>
    <link>http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2013/11/how-walmart-could-pay-decent-wage-without-raising-prices</link>
    <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"&gt;
&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walmart has gotten &lt;a href="http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/430680/november-19-2013/wal-mart-s-employee-food-drive" target="_blank"&gt;a lot of bad press&lt;/a&gt; this week over news of an Ohio store holding a food drive for its own workers, who were unable to buy Thanksgiving groceries on the retail giant's paltry wages. The store managers deserve credit for their thoughtfulness, but wouldn't it be better if Walmart simply paid its workers enough to feed themselves? A &lt;a href="http://www.demos.org/news/walmart-could-give-big-raises-without-raising-prices-demos-think-tank-says" target="_blank"&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt; from Demos, a liberal think tank, suggests that doing so wouldn't be as hard as you might think.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the report, "A Higher Wage Is Possible," Walmart spends $7.6 billion a year buying back stock. Those purchases drive up the company's share price, further enriching the Walton family, which controls more than half of Walmart stock (and for that matter, &lt;a href="http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2012/07/walmart-heirs-waltons-wealth-income-inequality" target="_blank"&gt;more wealth than 42 percent of Americans combined&lt;/a&gt;.) If Walmart instead spent that money on wages, it could give each of its 1.3 million US employees a $5.83 per hour raise&amp;mdash;enough to ensure that all of them are paid a wage equivalent to $25,000 a year for full-time work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walmart and its defenders like to argue that raising wages would require it to raise prices, which would in turn hurt its low-income shoppers. But Demos disagrees: "Curtailing share buybacks would not harm the company's retail competitiveness or raise prices for consumers," the report says. "In fact...higher pay could be expected to improve employee productivity and morale while reducing Walmart's expenses related to employee turnover."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for Walmart did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;

    <title>CHART: These Members of Congress Are Bankrolled by the Fracking Industry</title>
    <link>http://www.motherjones.com/blue-marble/2013/11/chart-these-members-of-congress-are-bankrolled-by-the-fracking-industry</link>
    <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"&gt;
&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growing fracking industry is "yielding gushers" of campaign donations for congressional candidates&amp;mdash;particularly Republicans from districts with fracking activity&amp;mdash;according to &lt;a href="http://crew.3cdn.net/29e185cb94de445559_rom6b5st3.pdf"&gt;a new report&lt;/a&gt; from the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report, "Natural Cash: How the Fracking Industry Fuels Congress," examines a period spanning from 2004 to 2012. In that time, CREW finds, contributions from companies that operate hydraulic fracturing wells and fracking-related industry groups rose 180 percent, from $4.3 million nine years ago to about $12 million in the last election cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These donations are flowing to members of Congress at a time when some legislators are trying to increase regulation of fracking, a process in which drillers inject a mixture of water, sand, and chemicals into the bedrock to release oil and natural gas reserves. The most serious of these legislative efforts is the &lt;a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:H.R.2766:"&gt;FRAC Act&lt;/a&gt;. First introduced in 2009, the act would require EPA regulation of the industry and would force fracking companies to disclose the chemicals that they inject under high pressure into the ground. Both the House and Senate versions of the bill are stalled in committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;p style="font-size: 1.083em;"&gt;&lt;a href="/blue-marble/2013/11/chart-these-members-of-congress-are-bankrolled-by-the-fracking-industry"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Continue Reading &amp;raquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>So Far, Obamacare Has Taken Only a Modest Hit in Polls</title>
    <link>http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/11/so-far-obamacare-has-taken-only-modest-hit-polls</link>
    <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"&gt;
&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I misread a poll question about Obamacare, initially thinking it was about whether people wanted to make changes to the law. Today, though, CBS has a poll question that really does ask this. &lt;a href="http://www.scribd.com/fullscreen/185695292?access_key=key-28jxl6lf7q97pw0g1g73&amp;amp;allow_share=true&amp;amp;view_mode=scroll" target="_blank"&gt;Here it is:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="center" alt="" class="image image-_original" src="/files/blog_obamacare_cbs_poll_repeal.jpg" style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 15px 0px 5px 60px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn't very different from &lt;a href="http://kff.org/health-reform/poll-finding/kaiser-health-tracking-poll-october-2013/" target="_blank"&gt;Kaiser tracking polls in the past.&lt;/a&gt; In the most recent one, among people who expressed an opinion, 56 percent wanted the law kept as is or enhanced, while 44 percent wanted it repealed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, Obamacare hasn't really taken that big a hit in public opinion, and as the website problems continue to get fixed I expect that public opinion will improve. It's still early days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;

    <title>Patent Reform Takes a Hit From the Tech Industry</title>
    <link>http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/11/patent-reform-takes-hit-tech-industry</link>
    <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"&gt;
&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim Lee reports that a key provision in Rep. Bob Goodlatte's patent reform bill &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/11/20/software-patent-reform-just-died-in-the-house-thanks-to-ibm-and-microsoft/" target="_blank"&gt;has been axed:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;One provision would have expanded what's known as the "covered business method" (CBM) program, which provides an expedited process for the Patent Office to get rid of low-quality software patents....The CBM program provides a quick and cost-effective way for a defendant to challenge the validity of a plaintiff's patent. Under the program, litigation over the patent is put on hold while the Patent Office considers a patent's validity. That's important because the high cost of patent litigation is a big source of leverage for patent trolls.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;The original CBM program, which was created by the 2011 America Invents Act, was limited to a relatively narrow class of financial patents. The Goodlatte bill would have codified a recent decision opening the program up to more types of patents....But large software companies had other ideas. A September letter signed by IBM, Microsoft and several dozen other firms made the case against expanding the program. The proposal, they wrote, "could harm U.S. innovators by unnecessarily undermining the rights of patent holders. Subjecting data processing patents to the CBM program would create uncertainty and risk that discourage investment in any number of fields where we should be trying to spur continued innovation."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be hard to overstate just how self-serving and absurd the IBM-Microsoft position is. The notion that an expedited process for evaluating business process patents would discourage investment is laughable. This is the purest example of special pleading since Rob Ford tried to justify his crack use by explaining that he was hammered at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which wasn't that long ago, was it? This just goes to show how common special pleading is&amp;mdash;and also goes to show just how seriously we should take it. The good news here is that apparently&amp;nbsp;the CBM provision is still alive in the Senate, so there's still a chance it could make it into the final bill. We can hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;

    <title>Etymology of the Day: Strategery</title>
    <link>http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/11/etymology-day-strategery</link>
    <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"&gt;
&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My incidental use of the George Bushism "strategery" in a post this morning sparked a Twitter exchange which produced an interesting factlet: George Bush didn't invent the word. Here it is in an 1845 short story by Mark Lemon, the founder of &lt;em&gt;Punch&lt;/em&gt;, titled &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=VTtAAAAAYAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA214&amp;amp;dq=strategery&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=pu6MUsjVK6O-sQSUooCQBA&amp;amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=strategery&amp;amp;f=false" target="_blank"&gt;"Never Trust to Outward Appearances":&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="center" alt="" class="image image-_original" src="/files/blog_strategery.jpg" style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 15px 0px 5px 40px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The particular strategery spoken of here involves one Caleb Botts, who was negotiating to marry away his daughter Fanny for his own benefit, but eventually gets outsmarted. I just thought you'd all like to know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt; Sorry. I'm reminded in comments that "strategery" was invented by Will Farrell in an SNL spoof of George Bush. As happens so often, fiction replaces reality in our memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;

    <title>Are Cuts to Virginia's Mental Health Programs Implicated in Creigh Deeds' Son's Attempted Murder/Suicide?</title>
    <link>http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2013/11/creigh-deeds-son-mental-health</link>
    <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"&gt;
&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update (11/20/13):&lt;/strong&gt; Despite initial reports that there were no hospital beds available for Austin Deeds, &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/state-mental-hospital-in-staunton-had-room-for-deedss-son-on-monday/2013/11/20/5faeccaa-51fd-11e3-9fe0-fd2ca728e67c_story.html" target="_blank"&gt;the Washington Post reported&lt;/a&gt; that at least three facilities did have room. This post has been updated to reflect this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Austin "Gus" Deeds underwent a psychiatric evaluation Monday at the Rockbridge County Community Services Board in Virginia. While at least three hospitals had beds available, &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/state-mental-hospital-in-staunton-had-room-for-deedss-son-on-monday/2013/11/20/5faeccaa-51fd-11e3-9fe0-fd2ca728e67c_story.html" target="_blank"&gt;hospital officials told the Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;, Deeds was still turned away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day he likely stabbed his father, Sen. Creigh Deeds (D-Va.), in the face and chest before shooting himself, police said. The elder Deeds is currently listed in good condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between April 1, 2010 and March 31, 2011, about 200 people in Virginia &lt;a href="https://www.odu.edu/content/dam/odu/offices/economic-forecasting-project/docs/2013SOR%20MentalHealth.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;met the criteria&lt;/a&gt; for a Temporary Detention Order&amp;mdash;meaning a physician of clinical psychologist saw a substantial risk of them causing harm to themselves or to others, or that they was unable to defend themselves&amp;mdash;but were put back on the streets, according to a report from the state Office of the Inspector General. The Commonwealth isn't the only state dealing with such problems.&amp;nbsp; States &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/12/17/seven-facts-about-americas-mental-health-care-system/" target="_blank"&gt;cut $1.8 billion&lt;/a&gt; from their mental health budgets from 2009-2011, according to a 2012 report from National Alliance on Mental Illness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="inline inline-left" style="display: table; width: 1%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Mental health charts" class="image" src="/files/Mental_chartspg_630-_0.gif"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also see our state-by-state &lt;a href="http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2013/04/map-states-cut-treatment-for-mentally-ill" target="_blank"&gt;interactive map&lt;/a&gt; of cuts to services for the mentally ill. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/04/mental-health-crisis-mac-mcclelland-cousin-murder" target="_blank"&gt;Mother Jones cover story&lt;/a&gt; six months ago, Mac McClelland wrote the harrowing story of her cousin Houston, who murdered his father after "a classic onset of schizophrenia." When Houston's violent outbursts started, his parents were told that calling the police was their only option&amp;mdash;even though the local cops had killed&amp;nbsp; two mentally ill men in the past six years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's also part of a pattern of exchanging one kind of institution&amp;mdash;state mental hospitals&amp;mdash;for another: jails. "In the 1950s, more than a half million people lived in US mental institutions&amp;mdash;1 in 300 Americans. By the late '70s, only 160,000 did, due to a concerted effort on the part of psychiatrists, philanthropists, and politicians to deinstitutionalize the mentally ill. Today there's one psychiatric bed per 7,100 Americans," Mac writes. But there's been a corresponding rise of incarcerated inmates who are mentally ill. Between 1998 and 2006, the number of mentally ill people incarcerated in federal, state, and local prisons and jails more than &lt;a href="http://www.hrw.org/print/news/2006/09/05/us-number-mentally-ill-prisons-quadrupled" target="_blank"&gt;quadrupled to &lt;strong&gt;1,264,300.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Those numbers have only gone up in the face of cuts to mental health programs due to the recession and austerity programs. See our timeline on the politics of deinstitutionalization &lt;a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/04/timeline-mental-health-america" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;

    <title>Why Are American Doctors Paid So Damn Much?</title>

&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conservatives have picked up today on a &lt;a href="http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/Stories/2013/November/19/doctor-rates-marketplace-insurance-plans.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;Kaiser Health News piece&lt;/a&gt; reporting on doctor complaints that insurers plan to pay them less for Obamacare patients than for other patients:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Insurance officials acknowledge they have reduced rates in some plans, saying they are under enormous pressure to keep premiums affordable. They say physicians will make up for the lower pay by seeing more patients, since the plans tend to have smaller networks of doctors. But many primary care doctors say they barely have time to take care of the patients they have now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/11/20/doctors_pay_under_obamacare_cut_the_whining.html" target="_blank"&gt;Matt Yglesias is unsympathetic.&lt;/a&gt; He says American doctors are very well paid and should quit griping: "If we ever reach the point where American doctors have been squeezed so badly that they start fleeing north of the border to get higher pay in Canada, then we've squeezed too hard. Until that happens, forget about it."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's pretty cold. But if you really want to know what's going on, take a gander at the chart below. It's from the OECD, &lt;a href="http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/factbook-2011-en/12/03/01/index.html;jsessionid=b6nujvonpfl0.delta?contentType=/ns/StatisticalPublication,/ns/Chapter&amp;amp;itemId=/content/chapter/factbook-2011-110-en&amp;amp;containerItemId=/content/serial/18147364&amp;amp;accessItemIds=&amp;amp;mimeType=text/html" target="_blank"&gt;so it includes all of the world's relatively rich countries:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="center" alt="" class="image image-_original" src="/files/blog_physicians_per_capita.jpg" style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 15px 0px 5px 10px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's damn peculiar, isn't it? If Econ 101 is to be believed, higher pay should produce more doctors. And yet, even though the United States pays doctors far more than any other country on the globe, we're in the bottom third. We have more doctors per capita than poorish countries like Mexico and Poland, but far fewer than Belgium and Britain and Germany&amp;mdash;all of which pay doctors considerably less than we do here. So what's going on?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Matt says, the basic answer is that U.S. doctors operate as a cartel. They artificially limit their own ranks, which drives up their compensation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;What we really ought to be doing is working to further pressure the incomes of doctors through supply-side reforms. That means letting nurse-practitioners treat patients without kicking a slice upstairs to an M.D., letting more doctors immigrate to the United States, and it means opening more medical schools. Common sense says that since the population both grows and ages over time, there should be more people admitted to medical school today than were thirty years ago. But that's not the case. Instead we produce roughly the same number of new doctors, admissions standards have gotten tougher, and doctors have become scarcer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is yet another reason not to shed too many tears for doctors. They've basically brought this on themselves. If the market were allowed to produce as many doctors as there's demand for, they'd already be getting paid less. Right now they're enjoying the substantial rents that come from squeezing their own supply, and they've fought like lemmings for decades to keep it that way. You can hardly blame them for that, but there's no reason the rest of us should put up with it. It's time to fight back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;

    <title>Chart of the Day: Strategy vs. Execution</title>
    <link>http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/11/chart-day-strategy-vs-execution</link>
    <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"&gt;
&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Via someone on Twitter whose name I can't quite dig up from my memory banks, today's chart of the day follows the declining appreciation of dreary execution relative to showy strategery over the past half century. This happens to be a pet issue of mine, and it also seems apropos in light of the Obamacare website fiasco. Always remember: amateurs talk strategy; professionals talk logistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;POSTSCRIPT:&lt;/strong&gt; This chart is, of course, meaningless since both words have multiple meanings. That's OK. Don't go all OCD on me. Just savor the alleged cultural evolution and add some humorous and/or bitter observations about it in comments.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Fight Over How to Stop Military Sexual Assault, Explained</title>
    <link>http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/11/mccaskill-gillibrand-military-sexual-assault</link>
    <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"&gt;
&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The military's sexual assault problem &lt;a href="http://www.usccr.gov/pubs/09242013_Statutory_Enforcement_Report_Sexual_Assault_in_the_Military.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;has reached epidemic levels&lt;/a&gt;. Some 26,000 service members were sexually assaulted in 2012, &lt;a href="http://www.usccr.gov/pubs/09242013_Statutory_Enforcement_Report_Sexual_Assault_in_the_Military.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;according to a report released this summer by the Department of Defense (DOD)&lt;/a&gt;&amp;mdash;up from 19,000 in 2010. This week, the Senate will begin consideration of legislation to curb the crisis. But a battle has emerged over how to solve the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The background:&lt;/strong&gt; Under the military justice system, if a service member is assaulted, the commander of the alleged perpetrator has the final say over whether charges should be brought.&lt;a href="#correction"&gt;*&lt;/a&gt; Commanding officers are also allowed to overturn sexual assault convictions. Top military brass say that commanders need this kind of prosecutorial discretion to maintain order and discipline within the ranks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two members of the Senate armed services committee&amp;mdash;Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.)&amp;mdash;disagree, and have put forward plans to reform the system. But they're at odds over how to fix it. Gillibrand heads up a coalition that believes military commanders should no longer have control over sexual assault cases, because current policy deters reporting of sex crimes and lets predators off the hook. McCaskill and her supporters in the Senate say Gillibrand's solution could actually increase retaliation against victims who report assaults, and could prevent some victims from bringing charges against attackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;p style="font-size: 1.083em;"&gt;&lt;a href="/politics/2013/11/mccaskill-gillibrand-military-sexual-assault"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Continue Reading &amp;raquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
